# LarryTheInventory
The project was started with the idea of recreating systems from work. It quickly became clear I can't make anything as advanced as what is made for work, but doing what I can is still fun anyway.

When finished the intention is to have a program that can be used to track and update what is in the inventory. The features are:
-See what is in the inventory
-Check the details of a given product
-Add new products
-Remove products
-Change/update the information for products
